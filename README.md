# VV285slides
These are the recitation files I made when I was the teaching assistant
for Honors Mathematics (VV285) in Summer 2019 at Shanghai JiaoTong 
University-University Of Michigan Joint Institute.

The course material mainly covers Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, 
and Integral Calulus.
